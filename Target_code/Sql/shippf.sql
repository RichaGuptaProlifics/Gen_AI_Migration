### Table Definition

The `CREATE TABLE` statement defines a new table named `Ship`. The table has three columns:

- `SHIPID`: A 10-character VARCHAR column that stores the unique identifier for each ship. This column is declared as the primary key, meaning that its values must be unique for each row in the table.
- `SHIPDESC`: A 25-character VARCHAR column that stores a brief description of the ship.
- `SHIPDATE`: A DATE column that stores the date when the ship was added to the database.

### Column Headings

The `ALTER TABLE` statement adds three new columns to the `Ship` table, each of which contains a heading for one of the existing columns. These headings are used to label the columns when the table is displayed or queried.

- `COLHDG(SHIPID)`: A 20-character VARCHAR column that contains the heading "SHIPPING ID".
- `COLHDG(SHIPDESC)`: A 20-character VARCHAR column that contains the heading "SHIPPING DESC".
- `COLHDG(SHIPDATE)`: A 20-character VARCHAR column that contains the heading "SHIPPING DATE".

### Best Practices and Design Patterns

This code follows several best practices and design patterns for database design:

- **Use descriptive column names:** The column names are clear and concise, making it easy to understand the purpose of each column.
- **Use appropriate data types:** The data types for each column are appropriate for the data that they will store. For example, the `SHIPID` column is a VARCHAR because it stores a unique identifier, while the `SHIPDESC` column is a VARCHAR because it stores a description.
- **Use primary keys:** The `SHIPID` column is declared as the primary key, which ensures that each ship has a unique identifier.
- **Add column headings:** The `COLHDG()` columns provide headings for the existing columns, making it easier to read and understand the table data.
